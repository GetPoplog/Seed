# Contents of x86_64/

This file provides a partial description of the contents of this folder.

* asmout.p - symbolic link to one of asmout.p.after_nopie or asmout.p.before_nopie, excluded
  from the git archive, so that changes are not picked up. This must match the pattern *.p
  so that it is included in the compilation of SysPop11 files.

* asmout.p.after_nopie - a version of asmout.p prior to GCC having the -no-pie option. It may
  not have the suffix *.p as we do not want the *.p globbing to include this file.

* asmout.p.before_nopie - the normal version of asmout.p that compiles using -no-pie. 
  We want this option in order to avoid creating code that is tagged as position independent.
  This inhibits Address Space Randomisation, which Poplog currently is incompatible with.
  
* genproc.p

* sysdefs.p
