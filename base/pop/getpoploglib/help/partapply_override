HELP PARTAPPLY_OVERRIDE                          Stephen Leach, Sep 2021

    partapply_override( <closure>, <args> ) -> closure

This procedure takes a closure and creates a copy with updated frozvals. 
The <args> may be a list or a dict. If args are a list of length N then
the frozvals from 1 to N are replaced by the elements of args.

If the args are a dict then the closure must have named frozvals and the
dict is used to update the corresponding frozvals.
