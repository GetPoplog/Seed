HELP strpr                                          Stephen Leach, Jan 2022

This procedure takes N arguments and prints them all to a string. It works
in a similar way to the infix >< operator but can be more efficient and readable
when there are many arguments.

Example:

    strpr(#| 'a', 'ab', 'abc' |#) =>
    ** aababc
