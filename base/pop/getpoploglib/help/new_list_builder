-- Introduction -------------------------------------------------------

A list-builder is a consumer procedure that constructs a list from all the
items that it is applied to. It is particularly useful for building lists
by adding to the end of the list, although you can also add to the start of
the list as an alternative.

The builder returns the list when it is applied to the special item <termin>.
For example:


    Setpop
    : vars b = new_list_builder();
    : b( 1 );
    : b( true );
    : b( 'three' );
    : b( termin ) =>
    ** [1 <true> three]
    :


-- Predicates on List Builders ----------------------------------------

List builders are closures so both isprocedure and isclosure is true
for any list builder.

is_list_builder( item ) -> bool
        Returns true if item is a list builder, false if not.


-- Constructing List Builders -----------------------------------------


new_list_builder() -> list_builder
        Returns a new, empty list builder.


-- Manipulating List Builders -----------------------------------------

list_builder_push_front( item, builder )
        Adds an item to the start of the list that is being built.


list_builder_push_back( item, builder )
        Adds an item to the end of the list that is being built. This
        is the same as calling builder( item )


list_builder_copylist( builder ) -> list
        This takes a copy of the in-progress list that is being built.
        Each time you take a copy you get a completely new list.


list_builder_newlist( builder ) -> list
        This returns the in-progress list _and_ resets the builder back
        to its initial empty state.
