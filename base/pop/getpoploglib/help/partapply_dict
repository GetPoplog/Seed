HELP PARTAPPLY_DICT                              Stephen Leach, Sep 2021

    partapply_dict( <procedure>, <dict> ) -> closure

This procedure produces a closure of an existing procedure (which may
itself be a closure). It takes two arguments - a procedure and a dict;
its result is a new procedure based upon the given procedure, but
requiring fewer arguments, the rightmost of the arguments of the new
procedure being supplied by the ordered values of the dict at the time
PARTAPPLY_DICT is called. e.g.

    vars Q =
        partapply_dict(
            procedure( x, a, b, c ) with_props quadratic;
                ( a * x  + b ) * x + c
            endprocedure,
            ${ a = 1, b = 2, c = 1 }
        );

    Q( 4 ) =>
    ** 25

The closure will have N named frozen values, where N is the size of the dict.
Named frozen values can be overridden (see HELP * PARTAPPLY_OVERRIDE)

    vars R = partapply_override( Q, ${ b = 0, c = -4 } );
    R( 4 ) =>
    ** 12
