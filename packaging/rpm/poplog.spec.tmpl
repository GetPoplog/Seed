%description
Poplog is a software development environment for the programming languages
POP-11, Common Lisp, Prolog, and Standard ML.

# Currently, poplog ships some .so files which cause the post RPM build
# check to fail as they don't have build IDs stamped within them. We
# can't do much about that, so we tell rpmbuild to ignore them.
