About the Poplocal tree
=======================

The poplocal folder is reserved for locally installed extensions to the
Poplog system. These extensions are fully integrated with the main system,
as if they were part of the core system.

Unlike the main Poplog-tree that extends the full set of search-paths, the 
poplocal-tree only extends a couple of search-paths, out of the box.

  * $poplocalauto (default $poplocal/auto) - a folder for autoloadable
    definitions.

  * $poplocalbin (default $poplocal/psv) - a folder that is searched for
    saved images.

To learn more about search paths, see HELP SEARCH_LISTS.
