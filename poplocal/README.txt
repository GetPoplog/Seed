About the Poplocal tree
=======================

The poplocal folder is reserved for locally installed extensions to the
Poplog system. These extensions are fully integrated with the main system,
as if they were part of the core system.

The poplocal-tree is not as fully developed as the main Poplog-tree and,
out of the box, only has two subfolders pre-defined.

  * $poplocalauto (default $poplocal/auto) - a folder for autoloadable
    definitions.

  * $poplocalbin (default $poplocal/psv) - a folder that is searched for
    saved images.
